                                <p class="card-text">Slikong is a lesser-known indie action-platformer that blends precision movement with intense combat. The game challenges players with environments that require quick reflexes, creative problem-solving, and mastery of character mechanics. Unlike traditional platformers that focus mainly on jumping and avoiding obstacles, Silkong puts a strong emphasis on combining movement and fighting. Each encounter feels like a puzzle where you need to chain attacks, dodge enemy strikes, and use the terrain to your advantage.</p>

The game follows Isaac, a young boy who flees into the basement of his home to escape his fanatically religious mother. What he finds is a twisted labyrinth full of monsters, strange power-ups, and nightmarish imagery drawn from biblical and psychological themes.</p>

At its simplest, biking provides a healthy and eco-friendly way to travel short or long distances. It reduces reliance on cars, cuts down on pollution, and offers a cost-effective alternative to fuel-powered transportation. Many cities have embraced biking by adding dedicated bike lanes, bike-sharing programs, and community riding events.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">Haoren Chen is a dedicated and versatile individual with a strong academic foundation and a growing portfolio of technical projects that highlight his creativity, problem-solving skills, and passion for software development. His journey began with an undergraduate degree in Economics at the City College of New York (CCNY), where he developed a solid analytical mindset and learned how to break down complex systems into measurable, interpretable components. This background gave him a unique perspective on data, decision-making, and human behavior — skills that would later become invaluable in the world of programming and software engineering.

After completing his undergraduate studies, Haoren pursued a master’s degree in Software Development at Boston University, a program that allowed him to bridge his analytical strengths with technical expertise. During this time, he built proficiency in several programming languages including Java, Python, PHP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Each of these languages became a tool in his growing toolkit, enabling him to approach problems from different angles — whether he was designing full-stack web applications, building predictive models, or creating user-friendly interfaces. His work reflects a commitment to both functionality and usability, ensuring that the solutions he develops not only work efficiently but also serve real-world needs.

One of his standout projects was a Dota 2 win-rate prediction system that achieved over 85% accuracy. This project showcased his ability to combine statistical modeling, machine learning techniques, and game analytics to create a system that could make predictions in a competitive and highly complex gaming environment. It demonstrated not only his technical ability but also his interest in applying technology to areas that capture human creativity and competition. Another project, a calendar system with reminder features, highlighted his practical mindset. By designing a tool that sends notifications through email and phone, Haoren tackled the everyday problem of time management, showing how thoughtful software design can simplify and improve daily life.

Although he does not yet have internship experience, Haoren has built a strong foundation through these independent projects. They reflect his initiative, discipline, and eagerness to apply his skills to real challenges. His experience shows that he is not afraid to take on ambitious tasks, learn new concepts quickly, and see projects through from start to finish. Moreover, his dual background in Economics and Software Development sets him apart: he combines a data-driven, analytical mindset with the technical expertise needed to turn ideas into working systems.

Beyond the code, Haoren is motivated by curiosity and a desire to grow. He sees software not just as a technical field but as a way to solve problems, connect people, and create meaningful tools. Whether it’s through predictive modeling, web development, or innovative applications, he aims to continue honing his skills and contributing to projects that have both technical depth and practical impact. Looking ahead, Haoren is excited to bring his unique blend of analytical and technical expertise to professional opportunities where he can collaborate, learn, and make a tangible difference.</p>
